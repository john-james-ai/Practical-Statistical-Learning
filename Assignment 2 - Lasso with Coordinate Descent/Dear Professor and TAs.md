Dear Professor and TAs.

I've come across various Coordinate Descent algorithms along the way and in various readings, i.e.

- Gauss-Southwell Block Coordinate Gradient Descent
- Randomized Block Coordinate Gradient Descent
- Cyclic Block Coordinate Gradient Descent

How would the technique from class fit within the space of Coordinate Descent algorithms such as these? Also, from a practitioners perspective, it would be interesting to understand:

- In which ways do these algorithms substantially differ?
- To what extent do convergence properties vary among these algorithms and data sets?
- When would one choose Coordinate Descent over Gradient Descent or one of its variants? For which problem sets do Coordinate Descent algorithms outperform other optimization algorithms? 

Not to be the bromidic practitioner, but how would you characterize the importance of Coordinate Descent today for the toolkit? 

Thank you!
